DreamGL - http://www.ui.com.au
==============================

DreamGL is an OpenGL-like graphics library written completely from scratch.
The current release only supports Sony's Playstation2 console.

The code is not based on any existing OpenGL code base. It was developed
independently, with the aim of taking complete advantage of the target
hardware platform.

The current API subset is based on the 1.1 OpenGL specification and is
similar in functionalty to the MiniGL drivers used by games like id's
Quake I and II.

We have made this early release of DreamGL available in order to provide a
usable and useful tool to the Playstation2 community as early as possible.

We will be releasing frequent snapshots of the source code, so keep coming back!
It is our hope that by following its constant evolution, you will find DreamGL
both useful and educational.

Any constructive feedback would be greatly appreciated.
