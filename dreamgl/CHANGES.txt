DreamGL v0.2 - 2003/06/19 - Changes From Previous Version
==============================================================================

* Found a great quote in Moller & Haines's "Real Time Rendering":

    "premature optimization is the root of all evil."
    		-Donald Knuth

* Biggest Change == Time. Currently putting in < 8 hours a week :-(

* Focus is still on keeping everything Simple and Naiive.
  - I'm currently learning about 3D rendering, and hopefully so will you.
  - Lots of Code Simplification and cleaning. I think you will find things
    MUCH easier to understand in this version.
  - Not going to worry any more about keeping PS2 and "generic" bits
    separate. Going to focus on building fastest possible Open/MiniGL
    for PS2 :-)

* Removed intermediate Vertex, Color, and Texture buffers.
  - Treating everything like a state machine for now...sending things to
    the DMA buffer as they come.
  - Vertices are transformed as they arrive, one at a time.
  - I realize it will need to change again, and introduce some sort of
    buffering again, when I do culling/clipping/VU1 code, but it's much
    cleaner this way for now.
  - Eventually will have a custom "pipe" for each primitive type.

* Added DGLcontext member, GLboolean VSync, to let you select whether to
  wait for vertical retrace before swapping buffers.

* Added timer code to DrFreak demo, for benchmarking.

* Created TOOLS directory and included BMP2C and MD2C in there.

* Created CONTRIB directory. All "contributed" demos and code will be put
  in there. DrFreak can now be found here.


*** Some stuff about the PS2 timers and how to (not?) use them:

  - DrFreak has 593 triangles.

  - Was getting weird FPS readings with the different timers. This meant
    that either my timer code was crap, or the way I'm calculating FPS
    was crap, or something else.

  - I sampled two timers (with different resolutions) in the demo (see
    main_ps2.c), so I could compare the two. They each indicated
    different FPS.

  - I thought it could have something to do with waiting for Vertical
    Retrace, so I disabled it in dglSwapBuffers(). The indicated FPS jumped
    up to somewhere slightly less than double what they were before, but
    the two timers still indicated different FPS :(

  - Thought for a minute about how the timers might actually work, and decided
    that it was possible my timer samples were crap because they're possibly
    "overflowing" or re-setting (doh...don't sample AFTER vertical retrace),
    in other words: DrFreak is taking slightly more than 1/25th of a second
    (I have a PAL system) to "render" (a single frame...pathetic isn't it:)

  - I halved the number of triangles to be drawn, and bingo: the indicated
    FPS's shot up again, and this time they both matched.

  - This means that during these early stages of DreamGL, I need to make
    sure not to draw too much, so that it all fits in a single frame.

  - So, 400 triangles currently drawn around 126 times per second, makes around
    50,000 textured and colored triangles per second. We can only get faster
    from here ... right????????????

* NOTE: Does all this sound right? or is it totally wrong? The Sony documentation
  is very scarce on this topic.

  - I've forced the DrFreak demo to only draw the first 400 triangles for now.
    Unfortunately, this removes the poor guy's head.

  - Target for DreamGL v0.3: Return DrFreak's 193 triangles to him within
    a single Frame...and add some more API functionality to the library.
    Possible features/optimizations:
      * Reduce DMA buffer usage by around 1/3rd.
      * Do some matrix and transform optimizations.
      * Split into separate geometry pipes, with multiple stages each.
